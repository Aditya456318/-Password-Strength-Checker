# -Password-Strength-Checker
This project is a simple yet powerful Password Strength Checker built as part of my coursework for the BCA-IBM program. It evaluates the strength of a password in real time based on several important criteria, including length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
